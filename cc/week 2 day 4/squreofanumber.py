#Write a program which will print square of a number.
# Some random values
valueA = 4
valueB = 2
valueC = 6


# Square each value
squareA = valueA ** 2
squareB = valueB ** 2
squareC = valueC ** 2


# Output each value squared
print(valueA, "square is =", squareA)
print(valueB, "square is =", squareB)
print(valueC, "square is =", squareC)
